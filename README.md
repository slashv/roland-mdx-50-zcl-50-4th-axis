# Fusion 360 machine Configuration for Roland MDX-50 4th Axis (ZCL-50 addon)

I finally figured out how to use the 4th axis on the Roland MDX-50 CNC machine with the ZCL-50 addon so I thought I'd share the machine configuration here for anyone else who's intersted.

I'll record a video soon to show the complete process and add the link her.
