# Fusion 360 machine Configuration for Roland MDX-50 4th Axis (ZCL-50 addon)

I finally figured out how to use the 4th axis on the Roland MDX-50 CNC machine with the ZCL-50 addon so I thought I'd share the machine configuration here for anyone else who's intersted.

I modelled a basic version of the rotary addon and added the A-axis to the machine config.

The .f3d file is what you would import into the Fusion 360 Machine Library and that should also include by default the post-processor. For reference I've also included the post processor file here but it's just the standard one provided by Roland version 45917 which I know works.

I'll record a video soon to show the complete process and add the link her.
